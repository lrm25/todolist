This is a todolist program I wrote for myself.
Instructions later.

Possible future improvements:
* Add instructions
* More organized display
* Date and time error-handling
* Not having to be so specific with the date format
* Allow desired complete days from now, in addition to desired or required due date
* Allow "am" and "pm" in addition to military time
* Allow user to display only one list
* Allow user to display tasks of certain priority
* Allow recurring tasks
* Allow task string matching
* Verbose - display ignored lines
* Remove ".txt" from list display
* Display completed tasks at bottom?
* Add difficulty rating
* Revamp sorting, try using priority string
* Header
* Task separation by priority
* General cleanup
* Testing
